# Shitty-Calculator
A coulpe of lines of shitty java indian shitcode. Currently supports brackets, '+', '-', '*', and '/' (everything is hard coded so no modularity :( ). Planning to add support of bitwise operators(and, or, xor), exponentiation, and custom math functions which should be modular(should is the main word here).
Just launch it and type whatever math expression you want
It sucks, i know
